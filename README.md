# Final-Assignment
Final Assignment
In this assignment, you each receive a dataset and you will do a causal analysis study using Python.

This dataset contains information about a digital transformation program that was rolled out. You are interested in the effect of this program indicated by the  "digital_transformation program" on the outcomes "productivity_score"and "employee_satisfaction".

Your goal is to investigate the average treatment effect as well as any heterogeneous treatment effects.

Write a 1500-word (excluding references) report to a company to explain the causal effects of the digital transformation program. In this report, you need to explain which effects you are trying to test, how you tested them, provide them with visualizations and results, and, finally, explain what this information means. You will conduct the analysis in a Python Notebook.

You are allowed to use Generative AI (ChatGPT, Github Co-Pilot or similar) for coding. You are not allowed to use Generative AI to write any words to use in the report. Please think carefully about the prompts you use throughout the analysis and write each prompt in a Generative AI Appendix at the end of your report. In this Generative AI Appendix, write the name of the Generative AI you used and the prompts. If you are using any method outside of this course or a package, please list them in a reference list at the end of your report.

You can use the following structure in your report:

Introduction
Data
Analysis
Results
Findings
       Generative AI Appendix.

To start the assignment, please do the following:

Download the attached data file "digital_transformation.csv" and the Python Notebook "Data_Assignment.ipynb" into one folder.
Files:

Data_Assignment.ipynbDownload Data_Assignment.ipynb

digital_transformation.csvDownload digital_transformation.csv

Variable Descriptions.docxDownload Variable Descriptions.docx

Open the "Data_Assignment.ipynb" notebook in VScode and make sure VScode is open in this folder.
Enter your student number into the script.
Run the code chunk (make sure you Select Kernel to Python in the upright corner).
Now you have generated a new CSV file called "digital_transformation_unique.csv" in the same folder.
Use the "digital_transformation_unique.csv" dataset for your analysis.
Please upload your dataset (digital_transformation_unique.csv), your report (PDF with a Generative AI Appendix at the end) and your Python Notebook (.ipynb). Label both the report and the notebook files with your student number (student_number.pdf and student_number.ipynb)

Please do so  before Friday, 20 June at 23:59.

Best of luck!
